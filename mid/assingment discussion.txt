From of the graph we see that when the number of N is increasing the accuracy is also increasing 
in Manhattan method On the other hand when the number of N is increasing the accuracy also 
decreaseing in the Euclidean method .From of the model , maximum accuracy is 0.208 for the 
Manhattan method.So we say that the Manhattan method predict more accurate rather than the 
Euclidean method so Manhattan method is the best method.
